The Lua script in here is intended to be run on an ESP8266 board (like
https://github.com/wjblack/basicesp/tree/master) running NodeMCU with the
following modules installed:

* crypto
* gpio
* net
* node
* timer
* wifi

We assume there's a pushbutton (to enable ExpressIF's smartconfig) connected
to a GPIO (GPIO0 is good for that) and a motion sensor hooked up to another
GPIO.

Everything in the script is edge-triggered (high->low) and executed using a
number of callbacks and timeouts (kinda like a JavaScript nightmare, really
:-/).

I assume you're familiar with flashing NodeMCU and uploading files using
e.g. nodemcu-uploader.  This file should probably be uploaded as init.lua
(assuming you want it to start on boot).

Development status
I just wrote this thing.  No debugging has been done yet :-)
